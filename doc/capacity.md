# Determining generator capacity

For detailed description of different methodologies please read the article of *Kerwin Rakness* on **Guideline for Measurement of Ozone Concentration in the Process Gas From an Ozone Generator** [here](Ozone_measurement.pdf).

## Ozone detector devices

Simplest way to determine the capacity of a generator is with a calibrated measurement unit, such as this:

* Typical range 10 ppm - 1000 ppm
* Price 250 - 1500 EUR

:warning: The proposed **DIY process controller** can be used as a measurement device as well.
