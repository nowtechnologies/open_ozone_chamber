# Ozone generator

### Off the shelf generators

Room and car air purifiers can meet the requirements if we take into consideration that **for every cubic meter** a generator capacity of **~200 mg/h** is required. Mid-sized generators for homes produce between 2.5 - 10 grams / hour.

#### Advantages

* Fastest way to start with.
* It has been built and tested.
* It has the capacity to sterilize a complete room. *( 5-10 g/h )*
* The indicator and timer is already built in. *( also potential disadvantage )* 

#### Disadvantages

* Price range can vary from 100-1000 EUR.
* It runs only from AC. *( battery operation requires disassembly or an inverter )*
* There might be some difficulties with the supply chain.

### Ozone plate generator modules

Generator modules come in different shapes and sizes, the most frequent types are based on ceramic plate electrodes. These modules also easily met the minimum capacity requirements. As a thumb rule one plate *( ~100x50mm )* can produce ~5 g/h ozone. The modules can be either DC or AC powered by type.

#### Advantages

* Fairly fast way to start with.
* Functional module, already tested.
* More then enough capacity.
* Easy to scale up.
* Easy to control.
* Fair price *( as of know ~30 EUR for a 10 g/h module )*

#### Disadvantages

* All the other components needs to be built around it.
* There might be some difficulties with the supply chain. *( as produced in China )*

### Generator module from scratch

At a pinch the module can be built from electronic components.

#### Electrodes

The electrodes are the **critical parts** of a generator as the instable ozone molecules are formed when the atmospheric oxygen molecules are forced into a higher energy state by the corona arc on the surface of the electrodes. Corona is generated by applying high voltage electrical energy to the active element on the electrode and then discharging this energy through the dielectric ceramic to the ground pole. This process generates a significant amount of heat. The more power applied the greater the heat generated.
